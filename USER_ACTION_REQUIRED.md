# üéØ Action Required: Complete Your Setup

The file upload implementation is **complete**, but you need to configure a few things to make it work!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Update Your Environment Variables

### Step 1: Edit `.env.local`

The `.env.local` file cannot be auto-created for security reasons. **You must create it manually.**

1. Create the file in your project root:
   ```bash
   cd /home/agent/workspace/openai-chatkit-starter-app
   touch .env.local
   ```

2. Add these variables:
   ```bash
   # Your OpenAI API Key (required)
   # Get from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your-actual-api-key-here
   
   # Your Workflow ID (required for file upload)
   # Get from: https://platform.openai.com/agent-builder (click "Publish")
   CHATKIT_WORKFLOW_ID=wf_your-actual-workflow-id-here
   
   # Optional: Custom API base URL
   # CHATKIT_API_BASE=https://api.openai.com
   ```

3. **Replace the placeholder values** with your actual credentials

### Step 2: Configure Your Workflow

Your Agent Builder workflow needs to accept file uploads:

1. Go to [Agent Builder](https://platform.openai.com/agent-builder)
2. Open your workflow
3. Add these input parameters:
   - **`prompt`** (type: string, required) - The user's message
   - **`file_ids`** (type: array, optional) - Array of uploaded file IDs
4. Update your workflow logic to process the files
5. **Click "Publish"**

### Step 3: Start the Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit: `https://localhost:3000`

(You'll see a certificate warning - click "Advanced" ‚Üí "Proceed" - this is normal for local development)

### Step 4: Test It!

1. Click **"+ Add file"** button
2. Select a file (PDF, image, text, etc.)
3. Type a prompt like: *"Summarize this file"*
4. Click **Send**

‚úÖ Check your browser console for:
```
Uploading file: yourfile.pdf
Workflow run created: run-xyz123
```

## ‚ùó Common Issues

### "Missing CHATKIT_WORKFLOW_ID"
üëâ You forgot to create `.env.local` or add the workflow ID

### "Missing OPENAI_API_KEY"
üëâ You forgot to add your API key to `.env.local`

### File uploads but no response
üëâ Your workflow isn't configured to accept `file_ids` parameter

### Server won't start
üëâ Make sure you created `.env.local` and added both variables

## ‚úÖ Checklist

Before testing, make sure you've completed:

- [ ] Created `.env.local` file
- [ ] Added `OPENAI_API_KEY` to `.env.local`
- [ ] Added `CHATKIT_WORKFLOW_ID` to `.env.local`
- [ ] Replaced placeholder values with real credentials
- [ ] Configured workflow to accept `prompt` and `file_ids`
- [ ] Published your workflow in Agent Builder
- [ ] Started dev server with `npm run dev`
- [ ] Visited `https://localhost:3000`
- [ ] Accepted the certificate warning

## üîê Security Note

**Never commit `.env.local` to git!**

This file is automatically ignored by `.gitignore`, but double-check:
- Your API key stays secret
- Your workflow ID stays server-side only
- No credentials in your repository

## üöÄ What's Next?

Once file uploads work:

1. Test with different file types
2. Customize the workflow to do something cool with files
3. Add file size validation (see implementation docs)
4. Deploy to production (see README.md)
