# 🎯 File Upload Issue - SOLVED

## Root Cause Identified

Your workflow has a **file size limit of 512 KB (0.5 MB)**. Any file larger than this will fail to upload.

### Current Workflow Configuration

```json
{
  "file_upload": {
    "enabled": true,
    "max_file_size": 512,    ← 512 KB = 0.5 MB
    "max_files": 10
  }
}
```

**Workflow ID:** `wf_68e96cb01e2c8190984930a610c404940ba9fe318a017dd6`

## ✅ Solution 1: Upload Smaller Files (Immediate)

**Test with a file under 512 KB:**

I've created a test file for you:
```bash
# This file is only 69 bytes
./test-small-file.txt
```

**Try uploading this file in your browser:**
1. Open `https://localhost:3000` or `https://10.18.2.36:3000`
2. Upload `test-small-file.txt`
3. ✅ It should work!

**Check file sizes before uploading:**
```bash
# In terminal
ls -lh your-file.pdf

# Should show size like:
# -rw-r--r-- 1 user user 250K Oct 12 file.pdf  ← OK (under 512 KB)
# -rw-r--r-- 1 user user 2.5M Oct 12 large.pdf ← FAIL (over 512 KB)
```

## ✅ Solution 2: Increase File Size Limit (Recommended)

To allow larger files, update your workflow configuration in OpenAI Agent Builder:

### Steps:

1. **Go to Agent Builder:**
   ```
   https://platform.openai.com/agent-builder
   ```

2. **Open Your Workflow:**
   - Find: `wf_68e96cb01e2c8190984930a610c404940ba9fe318a017dd6`
   - Click to edit

3. **Update File Upload Settings:**
   - Look for **"File Upload"** or **"Attachments"** settings
   - Change **Maximum File Size** from `512 KB` to a higher value:
     - `10240 KB` (10 MB) - Good for most documents
     - `25600 KB` (25 MB) - Good for larger files
     - Or whatever your needs require

4. **Important: REPUBLISH the Workflow**
   - Click "Publish" or "Save & Publish"
   - Wait for deployment to complete

5. **Restart Your App:**
   ```bash
   make restart
   ```

6. **Test Again:**
   - Try uploading your original file
   - ✅ Should now work!

## 📊 File Size Reference

| Size | KB | What fits |
|------|----|-----------| 
| **512 KB** | 512 | Small text files, small images |
| **1 MB** | 1024 | Medium documents, compressed images |
| **5 MB** | 5120 | Large PDFs, high-res images |
| **10 MB** | 10240 | **Recommended minimum** |
| **25 MB** | 25600 | Large documents, presentations |

## 🧪 Testing Different File Sizes

```bash
# Create test files of various sizes
echo "Small" > small.txt                    # < 1 KB
dd if=/dev/zero of=medium.bin bs=1024 count=256  # 256 KB
dd if=/dev/zero of=large.bin bs=1024 count=1024  # 1 MB

# Check their sizes
ls -lh small.txt medium.bin large.bin
```

With current 512 KB limit:
- ✅ `small.txt` - Will work
- ✅ `medium.bin` - Will work
- ❌ `large.bin` - Will FAIL

## 🔍 Verify Current Settings

To check your current workflow configuration:

```bash
cd /home/agent/workspace/openai-chatkit-starter-app
source .env

curl -s -X POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chatkit/sessions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${OPENAI_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "OpenAI-Beta: chatkit_beta=v1" \
  -d "{
    \"workflow\":{\"id\":\"${NEXT_PUBLIC_CHATKIT_WORKFLOW_ID}\"},
    \"user\":\"test-user\",
    \"chatkit_configuration\":{\"file_upload\":{\"enabled\":true}}
  }" | jq '.chatkit_configuration.file_upload'
```

Expected output:
```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "max_file_size": 512,    ← Current limit
  "max_files": 10
}
```

After increasing the limit and republishing, you should see:
```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "max_file_size": 10240,  ← New higher limit
  "max_files": 10
}
```

## 🎯 Quick Fix Summary

**For immediate testing:**
```bash
# 1. Use the small test file
open https://localhost:3000
# Upload: test-small-file.txt (69 bytes)
```

**For permanent solution:**
```
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/agent-builder
2. Edit workflow: wf_68e96cb01e2c8190984930a610c404940ba9fe318a017dd6
3. Change max file size: 512 KB → 10 MB (or higher)
4. REPUBLISH workflow
5. Run: make restart
6. Test with larger files
```

## 📝 Common File Sizes

To help you understand what 512 KB means:

- **Plain Text File**: 512 KB ≈ 500,000 characters (≈ 100 pages)
- **PDF**: 512 KB ≈ 5-10 pages (depending on images)
- **Image (JPEG)**: 512 KB ≈ 1-3 photos (compressed)
- **Image (PNG)**: 512 KB ≈ 1 screenshot
- **Word Document**: 512 KB ≈ 50-100 pages (text only)
- **Excel Spreadsheet**: 512 KB ≈ 5,000-10,000 rows

Most modern files (especially PDFs with images, PowerPoints, high-res images) exceed 512 KB easily!

## ✅ Verification Steps

After increasing the limit:

1. **Restart app:**
   ```bash
   make restart
   ```

2. **Check logs:**
   ```bash
   make logs
   # Look for successful session creation
   ```

3. **Test upload in browser:**
   - Open Developer Console (F12)
   - Upload a file
   - Check for success message

4. **Try progressively larger files:**
   - 100 KB → ✅
   - 500 KB → ✅
   - 1 MB → ✅ (if limit increased)
   - 5 MB → ✅ (if limit increased)

---

## 🚨 Still Having Issues?

If after increasing the limit you still can't upload:

1. **Clear browser cache** and reload
2. **Check browser console** (F12) for specific errors
3. **Verify workflow was republished** (check API response above)
4. **Try incognito/private browsing**
5. **Check file type** (some workflows restrict types)
