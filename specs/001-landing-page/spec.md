# Feature Specification: Modern Landing Page for Judgment Summariser

**Feature Branch**: `001-landing-page`
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "i want to create a modern cool looking landing page for this application which is a simple judgment summariser"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - First-Time Visitor Understanding Value (Priority: P1)

A first-time visitor arrives at the landing page and needs to quickly understand what the judgment summariser does, who it's for, and why they should use it, so they can decide whether to engage further.

**Why this priority**: This is the most critical function of any landing page - communicating value proposition within seconds. Without this, users will leave immediately. This addresses the "bounce rate problem" and is essential for any successful landing page.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading the landing page and verifying that within 5 seconds, a visitor can articulate what the product does without clicking anything. Delivers immediate understanding of product value.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor lands on the homepage, **When** they view the hero section, **Then** they see a clear headline describing the judgment summariser's core function
2. **Given** a visitor reads the hero section, **When** they scan the page for 5 seconds, **Then** they understand the primary benefit (saving time analyzing legal judgments)
3. **Given** a visitor is a legal professional, **When** they view the landing page, **Then** they recognize the product is designed for them through targeted messaging
4. **Given** a visitor wants more details, **When** they scroll down, **Then** they see key features or benefits explained in simple terms

### User Story 2 - Visual Appeal and Modern Design (Priority: P2)

A visitor experiences a visually appealing, modern interface that builds trust and credibility for the judgment summariser application, creating a positive first impression that encourages them to try the product.

**Why this priority**: Modern, professional design builds trust and credibility, especially for legal tech products. While not as critical as clear messaging, visual appeal significantly impacts conversion rates and brand perception.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by conducting user testing sessions where participants rate the visual appeal, professionalism, and trustworthiness of the landing page on a scale. Delivers a polished, credible brand image.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor views the landing page, **When** they assess the visual design, **Then** they perceive it as modern and professional
2. **Given** a visitor is on any device, **When** they view the landing page, **Then** the layout responds appropriately to their screen size
3. **Given** a visitor scrolls through the page, **When** they interact with elements, **Then** they experience smooth transitions and animations
4. **Given** a visitor views text content, **When** they read any section, **Then** typography is clear, readable, and follows modern design principles
5. **Given** a visitor assesses the design, **When** they compare it to competitors, **Then** it meets or exceeds current legal tech design standards

### User Story 3 - Call-to-Action Journey (Priority: P2)

A visitor who is interested in trying the judgment summariser can easily identify and click a clear call-to-action button that takes them to the application interface, creating a seamless path from landing page to product usage.

**Why this priority**: Converting interested visitors into active users is essential for product success. This bridges the gap between awareness and usage. While important, it depends on P1 (understanding value) being achieved first.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by tracking click-through rate on CTA buttons and measuring the time it takes users to navigate from landing page to application. Delivers measurable conversion metrics.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor decides to try the product, **When** they look for how to start, **Then** they see a prominent call-to-action button
2. **Given** a visitor clicks the primary CTA, **When** the action completes, **Then** they are taken to the judgment summariser application interface
3. **Given** a visitor is on mobile, **When** they want to start using the app, **Then** the CTA is easily tappable and visible without scrolling
4. **Given** a visitor scrolls through content, **When** they are ready to convert at any point, **Then** CTAs are available at multiple logical positions on the page

### User Story 4 - Feature Showcase and Benefits (Priority: P3)

A visitor who wants to learn more about specific capabilities can view a features section that explains how the judgment summariser works and what benefits it provides, helping them make an informed decision.

**Why this priority**: Detailed feature information helps convert informed buyers and reduces post-signup confusion. However, many visitors convert based on the value proposition alone (P1), making this supporting content rather than critical.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by asking users to list 3 key features after viewing the page and measuring comprehension. Delivers informed user decisions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor wants feature details, **When** they scroll to the features section, **Then** they see 3-5 key capabilities clearly explained
2. **Given** a visitor reads a feature, **When** they review its description, **Then** they understand what benefit it provides
3. **Given** a visitor reviews features, **When** they assess functionality, **Then** each feature is accompanied by appropriate visual elements or icons
4. **Given** a visitor wants to understand workflow, **When** they view the features, **Then** they can visualize how they would use the summariser in their work
