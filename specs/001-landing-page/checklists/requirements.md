# Specification Quality Checklist: Modern Landing Page for Judgment Summariser

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: Specification maintains focus on user needs and business outcomes without prescribing technical solutions. All content is accessible to non-technical stakeholders.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes**:
- All 12 functional requirements are specific, testable, and unambiguous
- All 8 success criteria include measurable metrics (percentages, time limits, scores)
- Success criteria focus on user outcomes (e.g., "visitors can articulate purpose", "bounce rate below 60%") rather than technical implementations
- Edge cases cover JavaScript disabled, slow connections, accessibility, browser compatibility
- Scope is clearly bounded to landing page creation (not the full application)
- Assumptions are implicit but reasonable (e.g., standard web design practices, accessibility standards)

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes**:
- 4 prioritized user stories cover the primary flows from P1 (value understanding) to P3 (feature showcase)
- Each user story includes acceptance scenarios that directly map to functional requirements
- Success criteria are aligned with user stories and requirements
- Specification remains implementation-agnostic throughout

## Validation Result: âœ… PASSED

All checklist items passed validation. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for the next phase.

**Recommendation**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create the implementation plan.
