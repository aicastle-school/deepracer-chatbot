# Tasks: Modern Landing Page for Judgment Summariser

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-landing-page/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md

**Tests**: No test tasks included - testing framework will be setup but test writing is deferred to future iteration per specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Next.js App Router**: `app/`, `components/`, `lib/` at repository root
- Paths follow existing Next.js project structure per plan.md

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and dependency installation

- [x] T001 Install @heroicons/react for icon components via npm
- [x] T002 [P] Install testing dependencies (@testing-library/react, @testing-library/jest-dom, @testing-library/user-event, jest, jest-environment-jsdom) via npm
- [x] T003 [P] Create directory structure: mkdir -p components/landing lib public/landing/icons
- [x] T004 [P] Create TypeScript types file for landing content at types/landing.ts

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core configuration and content that ALL user stories depend on

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T005 Create landing content configuration file at lib/landing-content.ts with LandingContent interface
- [x] T006 Define hero content in lib/landing-content.ts (headline: "Summarize Legal Judgments in Seconds, Not Hours", subheadline, CTAs)
- [x] T007 Define features array in lib/landing-content.ts (Instant Summaries, Key Points Extraction, Time Savings - 3 features minimum)
- [x] T008 [P] Add placeholder hero image to public/landing/ directory (legal-themed stock photo or placeholder)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion (T001-T004) - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase (T005-T008) completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel if staffed
  - Or sequentially in priority order (US1 ‚Üí US2 ‚Üí US3 ‚Üí US4)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on desired user stories being complete (minimum US1 for MVP)

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2, T008) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Enhances US1 but independently testable (visual design applies to all)
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Depends on US1 Hero component (T009) - Adds CTAs to existing Hero + new CTA section
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent Features component, no dependencies on US1-3

### Within Each User Story

- **User Story 1**: T009-T010 can run in parallel [P], then T011-T017 sequentially (Hero depends on CTA component)
- **User Story 2**: T018-T021 can run in parallel [P], then T022-T026 for testing
- **User Story 3**: T027-T029 can run in parallel [P], then T030-T035 (CTASection depends on existing Hero)
- **User Story 4**: T036-T038 can run in parallel [P], then T039-T047 (Features component development)

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup Phase**: T002, T003, T004 can run in parallel [P] (different concerns)
- **Foundational Phase**: T008 can run in parallel with T005-T007 [P] (image vs content config)
- **User Story 1**: T009 and T010 can run in parallel [P] (Hero and CTA are separate components)
- **User Story 2**: T018, T019, T020, T021 can run in parallel [P] (styling different aspects)
- **User Story 3**: T027, T028, T029 can run in parallel [P] (verification tasks on existing component)
- **User Story 4**: T036, T037, T038 can run in parallel [P] (Features component and icon imports)
- **Polish Phase**: T048, T049, T050, T051, T057, T058, T059, T062 can run in parallel [P] (independent concerns)

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch Hero and CTA components together:
Task T009: "Create Hero component at components/landing/Hero.tsx"
Task T010: "Create CTA button component at components/landing/CTA.tsx"

# Both can be developed in parallel since they're separate files
# Hero will import CTA once both are complete
```

## Parallel Example: User Story 4

```bash
# Launch Features component creation together:
Task T036: "Create Features component at components/landing/Features.tsx"
Task T037: "Create FeatureCard sub-component at components/landing/FeatureCard.tsx"
Task T038: "Import Heroicons in Features.tsx"

# All three can be developed in parallel
# Final integration happens in T039-T045
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only) - RECOMMENDED

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T004)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T005-T008) - CRITICAL
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T009-T017)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test landing page displays value prop clearly
5. Optional: Add minimal polish (T048-T051 for accessibility)
6. Deploy/demo MVP with just hero section

**MVP Deliverable**: Landing page with hero section communicating value proposition in <5 seconds

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Foundation**: Setup + Foundational (T001-T008) ‚Üí Configuration ready
2. **MVP**: Add User Story 1 (T009-T017) ‚Üí Test value prop independently ‚Üí Deploy
3. **Enhanced Design**: Add User Story 2 (T018-T026) ‚Üí Test visual appeal ‚Üí Deploy
4. **Conversion Optimization**: Add User Story 3 (T027-T035) ‚Üí Test CTA journey ‚Üí Deploy
5. **Feature Education**: Add User Story 4 (T036-T047) ‚Üí Test feature comprehension ‚Üí Deploy
6. **Production Ready**: Add Polish (T048-T062) ‚Üí Full accessibility & performance ‚Üí Deploy

Each story adds value without breaking previous stories.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **All devs**: Complete Setup + Foundational together (T001-T008)
2. **Once Foundational done**:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (T009-T017) - Hero section
   - Developer B: User Story 4 (T036-T047) - Features section (independent)
   - Developer C: Setup testing infrastructure for later
3. **After US1 complete**:
   - Developer A: User Story 2 (T018-T026) - Styling (enhances US1)
   - Developer B: User Story 3 (T027-T035) - CTAs (depends on US1 Hero)
4. **Final**: All devs on Polish (T048-T062) together

---

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing Checkpoints

**After User Story 1 (T017)**:
- Load http://localhost:3000/landing
- Verify headline is visible and clear
- Verify visitor can understand product purpose in <5 seconds
- Check mobile (320px), tablet (768px), desktop (1024px)

**After User Story 2 (T026)**:
- Assess visual design for modern, professional appearance
- Test hover states on CTA buttons
- Verify responsive layout at all breakpoints
- Test dark mode toggle if applicable

**After User Story 3 (T035)**:
- Click primary CTA and verify navigation to /app
- Test secondary CTA scroll behavior to #features
- Verify CTA is tappable on mobile device
- Test keyboard navigation (Tab to CTA, Enter to click)

**After User Story 4 (T047)**:
- Scroll to features section
- Count 3-5 features displayed
- Verify each feature has icon and description
- Ask test user to recall 3 features

**After Polish (T062)**:
- Run full Lighthouse audit (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO)
- Test on actual mobile devices (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
- Test with screen reader (NVDA, VoiceOver)
- Verify page load time <3 seconds on 4G

### Automated Testing (Playwright - Optional)

While test tasks are not included in this task list, once basic landing page is functional, consider adding:

- E2E test: Landing page loads and displays hero (T016 validation)
- E2E test: CTA click navigates to /app (T035 validation)
- E2E test: Features section displays 3+ features (T047 validation)
- Accessibility test: Lighthouse accessibility score 90+ (T053 validation)
- Performance test: Lighthouse performance score 90+ (T054 validation)

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability
- **Independent user stories**: Each story (US1-US4) can be tested independently
- **MVP scope**: User Story 1 alone is sufficient for MVP (hero with value prop)
- **Incremental delivery**: Each story adds value without breaking previous stories
- **Commit frequency**: Commit after each task or logical group (e.g., after T010, after T017)
- **Validation checkpoints**: Stop after each user story phase to test independently
- **File paths**: All paths are relative to repository root
