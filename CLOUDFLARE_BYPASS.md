# CloudFlare Bypass Workarounds

## Issue
CloudFlare is intercepting requests to `cdn.platform.openai.com` even in real browsers, showing challenges from `sentinel.openai.com`.

## Quick Fixes to Try

### Option 1: Wait and Retry
CloudFlare challenges sometimes resolve after:
1. Wait 10-15 seconds on the page
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Check if chat interface appears

### Option 2: Clear Browser Cache and Cookies
```bash
# In browser DevTools:
# 1. Right-click on refresh button
# 2. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
# OR
# Application tab → Clear storage → Clear site data
```

### Option 3: Try Different Browser
- Chrome incognito mode
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

### Option 4: Check Network/Firewall
Your network might be flagged. Check:
```bash
# Test direct access to OpenAI CDN
curl -I https://cdn.platform.openai.com/

# Test if your IP is blocked
curl -I https://api.openai.com/
```

### Option 5: Use Different Network
- Try from a different WiFi network
- Use mobile hotspot
- Use VPN (if allowed)

### Option 6: Contact OpenAI Support
If none of the above work, your IP/organization might be blocked:
1. Go to: https://help.openai.com/
2. Report: "Unable to load ChatKit CDN - CloudFlare blocking requests"
3. Provide: Your organization ID, IP address, error details

## Technical Workaround (Advanced)

If you can download the script from another location/browser:

1. Download chatkit.js successfully from a working environment
2. Host it locally in your Next.js app
3. Update the script tag to use local version
